                            This is a style guide page. It is a reference for the design of the website. It contains all the elements and components that make up the website. 
                            It is a guide for the design and development team to follow when creating the website. 
                            A style guide is a set of standards for the writing, formatting, and design of documents. It provides guidelines for how to present information in a 
                            consistent and coherent way, whether it's for a website, a marketing brochure, or a technical manual.

                            Consistency: Style guides ensure that all documents produced by an organization or for a specific purpose have a consistent look and feel.
                            This helps to create a professional and unified brand identity. 
                            Clarity: Style guides promote clear and concise communication by providing rules for grammar, punctuation, spelling, and other aspects of writing.
                            Efficiency: Style guides can save time and effort by providing a reference for common writing and design decisions. 
                            This reduces the need for individual writers or designers to make the same decisions repeatedly.

                            General style guides: These cover a wide range of topics, including grammar, punctuation, spelling, and formatting.
                            Examples include the Chicago Manual of Style and the Associated Press Stylebook. Discipline-specific style guides: These are tailored to the needs of 
                            a specific field, such as medicine, law, or journalism. Corporate style guides: These are created by individual organizations to ensure consistency in their own documents.

                                A drop cap, also known as a dropped capital or initial, is a large capital letter used as a decorative element at the beginning of a paragraph or section. 
                                It's a typographic technique that adds visual interest and can help guide the reader's eye into the text. Common Usage: Drop caps are frequently used in:
                                Books, especially at the start of chapters
                                Magazines and newspapers
                                Newsletters
                                Websites (though less common due to potential accessibility issues)
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>Small Print</h3>
            
                            <p><small>Small print is useful for when you want to create or construct the body of the copy.
                                Small print, also known as fine print or mouseprint, refers to text that is intentionally made very small, often in legal documents, contracts, 
                                or advertisements.It's designed to be less noticeable than the main text. Small print is often used to include disclaimers, terms and conditions, 
                                or other important information that the writer wants to include but doesn't want to draw attention to.
                                Companies are legally obligated to present information clearly and accessibly. If you believe the small print is intentionally deceptive or misleading, you may have legal recourse.

                            <p>
                            A pull quote is a key phrase or sentence taken from a longer text and displayed prominently, often within or alongside the main body of the text.  
                            It's a design element used to draw the reader's attention and highlight important points. Visually Distinct: They are typically set apart from the main text using:
                            Larger font size
                            Different font style (e.g., italic, bold)
                            Quotation marks (often decorative or oversized)
                            Boxes or other visual containers
                            Different background color
                            Indentation or spacing
                            Taken Directly from the Text: A pull quote must be a verbatim excerpt from the surrounding text. It shouldn't be paraphrased or summarized.

                                            As a CEO myself, I can deeply and convincingly say myself that IBEA really take off the charts when it comes to marketing 
                                            strategies. They most times out do themselves, they tranform, renovate and upgrade different companies and organizaions. I was a 
                                            bit sceptical in the beginning, when my friend introduced them to me but now I sing their praises at every chance I get. Kudos!

                                            My company sales was plumetting faster than I could say the company's name. But when my company's marketing department applied the 
                                            step-by-step principles instrcuted by Miss. Aimalohi, it turned around for our good. The sales margin went up by 40% and gradually 
                                            increased from there. I am glad I contracted IBEA Marketing and Logistics Company.
